          <a id="title">The Problem</a>
          <p class="lead"> There are multiple Good Country indexes. If a country is good for its people, it is
          good for the environment or involvement in global warming. But what what countries are bad? aren't you
          suppose to be able to avoid those? Also most of the time the Good country indexes are indicated on what
          the maker says is importand. As viewer you just have to believe their statements and watch. On some
          indexes it is completely fine, for example the greenhouse gass emmision indexes are just numbers. However
          when you are making a Good Country Index you should let the viewer diside what is "Good". So for this project
          we will let the viewer make a his own bad country index. So he can avoid this country, not buy products
          from these countries or whatever he likes to do with the given "bad countries".</p>

          <a id="title">The Solution</a>
          <p class="lead">In this visualisation the viewer can select how important he finds four catagories:
            1) CO2 emmision per Capita 2) Waste Generation per Capita 3) Animals in the Animal Industries per Capita
            4) Use of Wood resources (which contributes to deforestation in foreign countries).
            This will be done by sliding the slider of each category where a score of 0 says you do not care about this
            category and a score of 5 says you really think this is a problem. Depending on the values of the sliders the
            map change and color the bad countries darker than the good countries. Also a ranking will be shown on the right
            hand side of the sliders. countries in Europe have data of the Waste Generation or other categories so not all
            the countries will be taken into the visualisation however when setting this value to zero the countries who didnt
            have that value but did have the others will join the visualisation.</p>
          <p class="lead">To further inspect the data you can select the different countries by clicking on them this causes
            them to appear in the radar chart. By clicking the same country again this country will disapear again. 100% in the
            radar chart represents the amount of the highest country en 0% nothing however when no data is available it will
            show a point at 0% with NaN%. By clicking on the axis labels of the radar chart the bar chart will adapt to this
            information and show the data of all the countries when available. You can also change the order in the dropdown menu.</p>
