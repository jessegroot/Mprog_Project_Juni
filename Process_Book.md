# day 1 (11-1-2019)

This day i made the "Guide of the Program.md" file, in this file i set some global idears of the project
    1) What data i was going to used.
    2) graphs i wanted to make
    3) how the data needs to be formatted for the graphs
    4) how the Graphs should interact with each other.

I also made the file structure: D3, CSS, Data, Images and js_py(scripts).
I wanted to get the html files on opening of the map and the rest of the files in their own catagorisch.

I selected the Color style of the website.

I starded working on bootstrap since i was thought this would make it easy to structure the website into colloms.
However this didnt work at all. I struggled cause i wanted bootstrap in a file on my pc so i could work offline However
this didnt work and i struggled 3 hours with getting my bootstrap code to work but i didnt succeed. so after a while i
just coppied the links and used them to retrieve bootstrap coding and that worked at once....

# day 2 (15-1-2019)

I worked on my bootstrap code since i deleted my 10 other bootstrap codes since i thought it didnt work.
i thought of a layout of the website. that was about it.

# day 3 (16-1-2019)

corrected layout and added some pictures and text in Page_Home.
I made Page_Graph with the correct format and am ready to start working on the data and graphs.
I want to make 2 buttons on the world map at Page_Home to go directly to Problen&Solution also have to
resize the photos net to problem and solution.

# day 4 (21-1-2019)

My data files didnt seem to be good so i found data and selected it to be from 1995 till 2014.
I loaded in 3 of my 6 datasets in JSON formatted

# day 5 (22-1-2019)

I added the 4th file.
the 5th and 5th file couldnt be loaded in since it was seperated with ; and ,.
I do not have time to learn the xlsl import ways so ill just have to make my map just by selecting only
Population and GDP.
Tried to make a map but i was to tilted because someone said it was easy and i didnt understand how it was so
difficult since someone said it was easy... i rage quited and went home.

# day 6 (24-1-2019)

I managed to get an high grade for my other course and that gave me the mood to try doing this again.
I started making the map by really reading and understanding the code. However they used a tsv map so my old
idears of how to create the map went into the garbage. I still managed to make the map but with a lot of bugs.

# day 7 (25-1-2019)

I started repairing the bug and did notice that now i didnt use in and export i could use almost all countries on the map.
however i do not think i have time for it so ill focus on creating a working visualisation.
Ah i noticed you had to ask one question each day... i didt lol.
didnt do much this day due to lack of motivation.

# day 8 (29-1-2019)

just for fun i made the data correct and started on my second graph.
Noticed that at first you should look up the data format of the wanted graph instead of thinking you know the format.
Dataformats continiously change due to d3 updates and it is easier to make data graphs based on.
Since i have do not have correct data etc i stopped working since it made no sense.
I could technicly make it if i had some motivation. ill always say that tho haha.
