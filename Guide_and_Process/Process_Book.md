# day 1 (03-06-2019)

Made a plan for my project on forhand about different migration backgrounds and criminalitie however there was not enough depth in my visualisation.
This causes the deletion of a lot of work and i started working out a different project. However this didnt go smoothly cause i did want something
which i could correlate back somewhat to a political statement.

# day 2 (04-06-2019)

I made a vew plans however there was either not enough data for (car exidents in the netherlands per province and car deaths (only car deaths per province)),
data was to complex and to hard to optain (european parlemend related, inflation different coins, earopean tempature differences), data displays would be too
common (import export related things) or graphs would not have enough depth. So after a day of strugling i still had nothing.

# day 3 (05-06-2019)

Time pressure gets real however after a good night of sleep i got premision to work on one of the two proposals i did. My first idear was to research if not only
the tempature was going up but if the tempature differences day to day where also increasing. secondly i had the idea to make a european map where of the countries
would get a ranking from 1-28 depending on the importance of the viewer on 4 catogories: 1) involvement deforestation 2) Water reuse 3) CO2 emmision 4) waste generation.
Since the first project is easier i desided that if at start of day 4 i didnt have an european map i would do project one instead of two.


# day 4 (21-1-2019)

Since i managed to get a map i worked on getting the countries getting visual when hovering it. Also onclick the country name gets consoled logged. After this i worked At getting the Sliders for my project. This worked quite easly. I desided to place the Raderplot and Barchard both below the european map because the sliders took quite some spac.
